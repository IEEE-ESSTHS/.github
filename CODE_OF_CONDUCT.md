# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a welcoming and accessible experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
geographic location, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and impactful community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people  
* Respecting diverse opinions, experiences, and perspectives  
* Making events and resources accessible for everyone  
* Accepting responsibility and learning from mistakes  
* Supporting initiatives to bridge accessibility gaps  

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Discriminatory language or actions against any individual or group  
* Dismissing or discouraging feedback about accessibility  
* Failing to accommodate the needs of participants with disabilities  
* Ignoring the inclusion of rural and underrepresented groups  

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that does not align with these standards.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, contributions, or other interactions that do not uphold this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at **[contact@example.com]**.  
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.
